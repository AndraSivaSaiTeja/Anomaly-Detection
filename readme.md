2. Dataset
    > You should download MVTec from [MVTec AD: MVTec Software](https://www.mvtec.com/company/research/datasets/mvtec-ad/). The folder "mvtec" should be unpacked into folder.

3. Train and Test the Model
We have written training and testing code in the main.py and main_test.py, respectively. You have to just set the train and test path in the file main.py and main_test.py for training and testing purposes.

For training:

    > python main.py

For testing:

> python main_test.py
